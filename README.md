NavEye - XCode User Interface 
======

The NavEye project is an indoor localization system made to assist the blind population. Specifically, we make navigation easier by providing a solution to the indoor localization problem.  Our solution uses trilateration via a combination of RF and ultrasonic pulses. We generate a time-of-flight array from preplaced transmitters and send this array to an iPhone where a localization algorithm is used to calculate the personâ€™s location in the environment. The location is then conveyed to the blind person via text to speech software.
